# Fondue

A library of delightfully light extensions to simplify working with SwiftUI and Combine in real-world apps.

## Literal URLs
`URL` is now `ExpressibleByStringLiteral`, so we can conveniently express them like this:

    let url: URL = "https://server.domain/path"

We've deliberately restricted this to *literal* strings, since it's reasonable to expect that they're as free of typos as your code. ðŸ˜‰

## URL Parameters
We've taught URL to deal with query parameters like a dictionary[^1]:

    url.parameters["query"] = "fondue"

[^1]: Strictly speaking, URLs can have multiple parameters with the same name (e.g. `a=1&a=2`), and some server-side frameworks gather these into arrays. But in many real-life projects, we think of each parameter as uniquely-named. If this is your case, you might find it more convenient to treat query parameters as a dictionary.


## URL & URLRequest Modifiers
Inspired by SwiftUI's extensive use of modifers, we've given a few to URL and URLRequest:

    let base: URL = "https://server.domain/api"
    let url = base.with(parameters: ["query": "fondue"])
    
    let request = url.request(.post, path: "path")
        .adding(parameters: ["page": 1])

## ObservableProcessor
A convenient way to provide asynchronous data to a View. It publishes the output, busy state, and error states so that they can be bound to the View.

    struct SomeView: View {
        @StateObject var model = ObservableProcessor { SomeAPI.get() }
        :
    }
